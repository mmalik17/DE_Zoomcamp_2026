# Question 8
It is best practice in Big Query to always cluster your data: (1 point) <br>
a. True <br>
b. False <br>

Although clustering can reduce the cost, clustering also increase complexity in table structure. <br>
If the table is small (under 50MB) or the filtering is not frequent, the clustering wouldn't be useful and just add complexity,
so the answer is (b)
